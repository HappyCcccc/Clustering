# Clustering
Global optimization algorithm for clustering

It includes all experiments with a new global optimization algorithm on clustering. K-means algorithms sometime just finds the
local solution instead of global solution. And it's hard to choose a good starting point for clustering problem. The new global 
optimization algorithm are trying to find a good starting point for k-means.
